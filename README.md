# UP WP Cart
Simple cart plugin for WordPress

The plugin allow you to select a post type to be the products and a meta name to be the price.
With shortcodes, you can add a **ADD TO CART** button and a **CART PAGE**.
The plugin integrates with `contact form 7`, allowing you to insert on your contact form the user cart.

## Motivation
Most of the cart plugins/libraries for WordPress are only for `WooCommerce`. We want a simple plugin, that allow users to easily create a Shopping cart with any `post_type` and `post_meta` they want.

The plugin has/will have the following features:

 - post types and meta integration
 - Cart on user session
 - panel config screen (SOON)
 - Contact Form 7 integration (SOON)
 - RestFul API for theme developers (SOON)
 - Shortcode/Widgets support (SOON)
 - Cart Update with AJAX (no refresh) and theme integration (SOON)

## License
The plugin is under MIT license.

## Theme support
